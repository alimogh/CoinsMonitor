## Contributing guidelines
I’d love you to help me improve this project. To help me keep this project high
quality, I request that contributions adhere to the following guidelines.

- **Provide a link to the application or project’s homepage**. Unless it’s
  extremely popular, there’s a chance the maintainers don’t know about or use
  the language, framework, editor, app, or project your change applies to.

- **Explain why you’re making a change**. Even if it seems self-evident, please
  take a sentence or two to tell me why your change or addition should happen.
  It’s especially helpful to articulate why this change applies to *everyone*
  who works with the applicable technology, rather than just you or your team.

In general, the more you can do to help me understand the change you’re making,
the more likely I’ll be to accept your contribution quickly.

## Contributing workflow
Here’s how I suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to our `master` branch.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you
by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.
